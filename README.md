# MurmuringSpider

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/tomykaira/murmuring_spider.png)](http://travis-ci.org/tomykaira/murmuring_spider)


MurmuringSpider is a concise Twitter crawler.

When we write a data-mining / text-mining application based on twitter's timeline, we have to collect and store tweets first.

I am irritated with writing such crawler repeatedly, so I wrote this.

What you have to do is only to add query and to run them periodically.

Thanks to consistent Twitter API and [twitter gem](http://twitter.rubyforge.org/), it is quite easy to track various types of timelines (such as user_timeline, home_timeline, search...)

## Installation

    gem 'murmuring_spider'
